 OpenCV-Based Object Tracking Robot Using Image Processing with Raspberry Pi


Autonomous vision based robots are intelligent robots which take visual data, process it and provide appropriate output. These robots are totally independent anddonâ€™t need any kind of human intervention since they are preferred with instructions. A robot is designed on Raspberry Pi using OpenCV, which is used for objectdetection based on its colour, size and shape. Here only a single object isbeingdetected at a time. The tracking of the object is based on division of the imageintovirtual grids. The movement of the robot is based on the position of the object inthegrid. An arm is incorporated to pick the object once it is stationary. After pickingtheobject, it would be dropped into its respective coloured container whichhasapredefined position
